            <h3>The central station</h3>
            <p>The central station of Amsterdam was build between 1881 and 1889 by the architects A.L. van Gendt, P.J.H Cuypers and L.J. Eijmer.
                Today it is one of the busiest stations in the Netherlands. The central station that we know now was build to replace the in 1878 closed station Willemspoort.
                The central station is just like other buildings out that time build on wooden pillars. Some parts of the building were taken down and build again to modernize  
                them. This was also done to some of the parts on the inside. Curious to see how the central station looked in the 19th century, look it up on google it was beautiful then too.

            <p>The Dam is the historic heart of the city. On the Dam is one of the magnificent buildings the royal palace.The royal palace was in 1605 the government house and turned into the royal palace in 1808.
                It was build between 1648 and 1665 as the government house. The architect that designed the building was Jacob van Campen. The build of this building is seen as one of the most important historic and cultural moments of the golden century
                of the Netherlands. The balcony on the front side was only put on after 1808 by King Lodewijk Napoleon.He also added wooden walls on the inside to split the large rooms up into separate quarters. Now the building is only used for special 
                occasions, like when princess Beatrix did her departure from the throne.
